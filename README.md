OSACAN promotes the use of open source technology and foster its sustainability in Canadian public sector.

The Open Source Alliance of Canada is a Non-Profit established to encourage public sector IT managers, executives and their technology partners to explore, adopt and contribute to open source technologies.

## Our Mission

Through our centre of Excellence, we provide education, foster collaboration and promote best practices contribution, governance and adoption.

## Why Open Source for Public Sector?

Open source technologies have become the dominant tools in today's online information economy. Public sector institutions that use open source can demonstrate economic, service delivery and autonomy over their technology roadmaps. Redirecting money once spent on software licenses into the delivery of the departmental core mission demonstrates fiscal responsibility and focus on citizen services.

### Open Source Benefits

  - Lower total cost of ownership.
  - Greater control over technology roadmap and issue resolution.
  - Ability to use and share software with agencies with similar needs.
  - Build once, use many.
  - Faster delivery, innovation and adaptation to the demands of the digital economy.

### Collaborate, Share, Learn

Open source technologies are proven to be more secure, faster to adapt and easier to obtain than most traditional proprietary systems. Sharing code, modules, tips and expertise is fundamental to the open source ethos. No longer must public sector pay multiple times for the same customization services or development work. Systems integrators, consulting firms and educational institutions are better equipped to support open technologies by removing the costly barrier of license fees.

## Who we are

We are companies and Individuals supporting technology innovation for public good. OSACAN is backed by software providers, educational institutions, government, consulting firms and private individuals. Our shared mission is to raise the profile and awareness of open source as a way to save taxpayer dollars and increase efficiency, promote Canada as a leader in technology innovation and fast-track the delivery of essential public services.

Adoption of open source in federal, provincial and municipal governments is accelerating. Higher education and large NGOs are leading the way with us.
